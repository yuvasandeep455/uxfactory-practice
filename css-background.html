        <p class="para1"> The HyperText Markup Language, or HTML is the standard markup language for
            documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by
            technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages
            such as JavaScript. Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server
            or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages.
            HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally
            included cues for the appearance of the document. HTML elements are the
            building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other
            objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page.
            HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting
            structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links,
            quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written
            using angle brackets. Tags such as  and  directly
            introduce content into the page. Other tags such as</p>
        
      
       <p class="para2">
            surround and provide information about document text and may include other
            tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them
            to interpret the content of the page. HTML can embed programs written in a
            scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and
            content of web pages. Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of
            content. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the
            HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use
            of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997 The HyperText Markup
